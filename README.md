# AUI_Project_2024
A repository for our Advanced User Interfaces Project PoliMi


### Installation
First of all you will need to install __Unity__. Once downloaded the installer from the [__Unity webpage__](https://unity.com/download), you will need to log in with your account (or create one). Then install Unity, paying attention to <ins>__install the version 6000.0.25f1__</ins>. You can install, if you do not have it,  also __VisualStudio__ directly from here. No dependencies other than ones proposed in the installer are needed for now.
